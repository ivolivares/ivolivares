# ðŸ‘‹  Hey, I'm IvÃ¡n Olivares â€” a senior software engineer, vinyl enthusiast, and dog dad.

I'm currently working as a Tech Director at [Globant](https://www.globant.com/?from=github.com/ivolivares), based in Santiago, Chile. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights with the community through articles and [talks](https://iolivares.com/?from=github.com/ivolivares).

I started in the development world in 2004, experimenting with computers (often breaking things) and learning to program by researching online. At just 15, I built my first website â€” and never stopped. In 2010, I launched my first entrepreneurial venture with my first clients, and fell even more in love with technology.

My personal mission is to push the world forward by building bridges between people and technology.
