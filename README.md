# ðŸ‘‹  Hey, I'm IvÃ¡n Olivares Rojas

I'm a Software Developer living in Santiago de Chile. I currently work as a Tech Director at [Globant](https://www.globant.com) where I lead and manage engineering teams, previously I worked for [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com) in the streaming, media and entertainment industry.

In my free time, I like to help others to be part of technology through mentorship or [speaking on meetups/conferences events](https://iolivares.com/talks) to help to the new generations to learn together about technology.

I mainly work with JavaScript, mostly with Next.js but I am passionate about Node.js and backend technologies as well.
