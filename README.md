# ðŸ‘‹  Hey, I'm IvÃ¡n Olivares Rojas

I'm a Software Developer living in Santiago, Chile. I currently work as Digital Operations Manager at [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com) where I work on support streaming products, previously I worked at Globant.

In my free time, I like to help others to be part of technology through mentorship or speaking on meetups/conferences events to help to the new generations to learn together about technology.

I mainly work with JavaScript, mostly with Next.js but I am passionate about Node.js and backend technologies as well.
